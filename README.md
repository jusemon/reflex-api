# RefleX API

An API for save and get the top 10 scores of the
[RefleX](https://github.com/jusemon/reflex) game.

## Requirements

- Last stable version of MySQL (8 or greater)
- A PC with node.js (16 or greater) or docker

## Installation

For run locally it needs a `.env` file with the environment variables defined in
the `.env.example`

The database scripts are under the scripts folder, please run them in order.

### Development

ALLOWED_ORIGINS includes a comma-separated list of the allowed CORS sites.

Install dependencies `npm install` or `yarn` To start the project run
`npm run dev` or `yarn dev`

### Production

For run it in docker just run `docker compose up`

Alternatively, you can run the image without cloning this repo using the image
published
[here](https://git.jusemon.com/jusemon/-/packages/container/reflex-api/1.0.0)

With docker run (replace ${ENV_VARIABLE} with your values):

```sh
docker run -p ${PORT}:${PORT} -e NODE_ENV=${NODE_ENV} -e HOST=${HOST} -e PORT=${PORT} -e API_VERSION=${API_VERSION} -e ALLOWED_ORIGINS=${ALLOWED_ORIGINS} -e DB_HOST=${DB_HOST} -e DB_DATABASE=${DB_DATABASE} -e DB_USER=${DB_USER} -e DB_PASSWORD=${DB_PASSWORD} -e DB_PORT=${DB_PORT} -e COUNTRY_SERVICE=${COUNTRY_SERVICE} git.jusemon.com/jusemon/reflex-api:1.0.0
```

With docker compose (the ${ENV_VARIABLE} will be taken from the .env
automatically):

```yaml
name: reflex
services:
  api:
    image: git.jusemon.com/jusemon/reflex-api:1.0.0
    ports:
      - ${PORT}:${PORT}
    environment:
